Xazab uses the technology of Duff that is Dash because it follows our own ideas of what a cryptocurrency features should look like. We are separately going to build off our own from this technology just as we have started. Xazab transactions are faster, easier and transactions can be privately sent if you so want. The unique features have been built on this platform just like what dash did from litecoin. Our foundations and services range in different sections which range from providing the world with latest technologies to advertising your platforms in our XAZAB world class advertising platforms.  Our wallets range from all platforms including androids and IOS devices which you can download from the Android play stores etc. Xazab utilizes a decentralized system to provide a peer-to-peer connection between people and business owners.
